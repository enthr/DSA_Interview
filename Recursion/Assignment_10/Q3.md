# Question-3: Given a set represented as a string, write a recursive code to print all subsets of it. The subsets can be printed in any order.


```
Example 1:
Input :  set = “abc”
Output : { “”, “a”, “b”, “c”, “ab”, “ac”, “bc”, “abc”}

Example 2:
Input : set = “abcd”
Output : { “”, “a” ,”ab” ,”abc” ,”abcd”, “abd” ,”ac” ,”acd”, “ad” ,”b”, “bc” ,”bcd” ,”bd” ,”c” ,”cd” ,”d” }
```


## Solution


### Optimal Approach


#### Algorithm


- Time Complexity: $O(2^n)$ where n is length of set
- Space Complexity: $O(2^n)$ where n is length of set


#### Code


```javascript
const generateSubsets = (set) => {
    const subsets = [];

    const backtrack = (subset, index, set) => {
        if (index === set.length) {
            subsets.push(subset);
            return;
        }

        // Include the character at the current index
        backtrack(subset + set[index], index + 1, set);

        // Exclude the character at the current index
        backtrack(subset, index + 1, set);
    };
    backtrack("", 0, set);

    return subsets;
};
const set = "abcd";
console.log(generateSubsets(set));
```
