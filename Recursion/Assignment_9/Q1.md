# Question-1: Given an integer `n`, return `true` if it is a power of two. Otherwise, return `false`. An integer `n` is a power of two, if there exists an integer `x` such that `n == 2^x`.


```
Example 1:
Input: n = 1 
Output: true

Example 2:
Input: n = 16 
Output: true

Example 3:
Input: n = 3 
Output: false
```


## Solution


### Optimal Approach


#### Algorithm


- If n is less than or equal to 0, return false as negative numbers and zero are not powers of two.
- If n is equal to 1, return true as 2^0 is equal to 1.
- Recursively check if n is divisible by 2. If it is not divisible by 2, return false.
- If n is divisible by 2, divide it by 2 and make a recursive call to the function with the updated value.
- Repeat previous two steps until the base cases are met.
- Time Complexity: $O(logn)$
- Space Complexity: $O(logn)$


#### Code


```javascript
const isPowerOfTwo = (n) => {
    if (n <= 0) {
        return false;
    }
    if (n === 1) {
        return true;
    }
    if (n % 2 !== 0) {
        return false;
    }
    return isPowerOfTwo(n / 2);
}
const num = 16;
console.log(isPowerOfTwo(num));
```


### Alternate Non-Recursive Approach


#### Algorith


#### Algorithm


- In binary representation, a power of two has only one bit set to 1, and all other bits are zero. So, if you perform a bitwise AND operation between the number n and n-1, the result will be zero if n is a power of two.
- Check if n is positive and not zero.
- Perform the bitwise AND operation between n and n-1.
- If the result is zero, return true indicating that n is a power of two. Otherwise, return false.
- Time Complexity: $O(1)$
- Space Complexity: $O(1)$


#### Code


```javascript
const isPowerOfTwo = (num) => {
    if (num < 1) {
        return false;
    }
    return (num & (num - 1)) === 0;
}
const num = 16;
console.log(isPowerOfTwo(num));
```
