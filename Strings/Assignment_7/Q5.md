# Question-5: Given a string s and an integer k, reverse the first k characters for every 2k characters counting from the start of the string.


- If there are fewer than k characters left, reverse all of them. If there are less than 2k but greater than or equal to k characters, then reverse the first k characters and leave the other as original.


```
Example 1:
Input: s = "abcdefg", k = 2
Output: "bacdfeg"
```


## Solution


### Optimal Approach


#### Algorithm


- Time Complexity: $O(n)$
- Space Complexity: $O(n)$


#### Code


```javascript
const reverseStr = (s, k) => {
    const chars = s.split('');
    const n = chars.length;

    for (let i = 0; i < n; i += 2 * k) {
        let left = i;
        let right = Math.min(i + k - 1, n - 1);

        while (left < right) {
            const temp = chars[left];
            chars[left] = chars[right];
            chars[right] = temp;
            left++;
            right--;
        }
    }

    return chars.join('');
};
const s = "abcdefg", k = 2;
console.log(reverseStr(s, k));
```
