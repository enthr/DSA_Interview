# Question-8: Given two strings s and goal, return true if you can swap two letters in s so the result is equal to goal, otherwise, return false.


- Swapping letters is defined as taking two indices i and j (0-indexed) such that i != j and swapping the characters at s[i] and s[j].
- For example, swapping at indices 0 and 2 in "abcd" results in "cbad".


```
Example 1:
Input: s = "ab", goal = "ba"
Output: true
Explanation: You can swap s[0] = 'a' and s[1] = 'b' to get "ba", which is equal to goal.
```


## Solution


### Optimal Approach


#### Algorithm


- Time Complexity: $O(n)$
- Space Complexity: $O(n)$


#### Code


```javascript
const canBeEqual = (s, goal) => {
    const mismatchIndices = [];
    const commonChars = [];

    for (let i = 0; i < s.length; i++) {
        if (s[i] !== goal[i]) {
            mismatchIndices.push(i);
        } else {
            commonChars.push(s[i]);
        }
    }

    if (mismatchIndices.length === 2) {
        const [index1, index2] = mismatchIndices;
        if (s[index1] === goal[index2] && s[index2] === goal[index1]) {
            return true;
        }
    }

    if (mismatchIndices.length === 0 && commonChars.length < s.length) {
        const charSet = new Set(commonChars);
        return charSet.size < commonChars.length;
    }

    return false;
};
const s = "ab", goal = "ba";
console.log(canBeEqual(s, goal));
```
