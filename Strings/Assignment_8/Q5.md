# Question 5: Given an array of characters chars, compress it using the following algorithm:

- Begin with an empty string s. For each group of consecutive repeating characters in chars:
  - If the group's length is 1, append the character to s.
  - Otherwise, append the character followed by the group's length.
- The compressed string s should not be returned separately, but instead, be stored in the input character array chars. Note that group lengths that are 10 or longer will be split into multiple characters in chars.
- After you are done modifying the input array, return *the new length of the array*.
- You must write an algorithm that uses only constant extra space.


```
Example 1:
Input: chars = ["a","a","b","b","c","c","c"]
Output: Return 6, and the first 6 characters of the input array should be: ["a","2","b","2","c","3"]
Explanation: The groups are "aa", "bb", and "ccc". This compresses to "a2b2c3".
```


## Solution


### Optimal Approach


#### Algorithm


- Time Complexity: $O(n)$
- Space Complexity: $O(1)$


#### Code


```javascript
const compress = (chars) => {
    let index = 0;
    let count = 1;
    let currentChar = chars[0];

    for (let i = 1; i <= chars.length; i++) {
        if (i < chars.length && chars[i] === currentChar) {
            count++;
        } else {
            chars[index] = currentChar;

            if (count > 1) {
                let countStr = count.toString();
                for (let j = 0; j < countStr.length; j++) {
                    chars[++index] = countStr[j];
                }
            }

            index++;
            if (i < chars.length) {
                currentChar = chars[i];
                count = 1;
            }
        }
    }

    return index;
};
const chars = ["a", "a", "b", "b", "c", "c", "c"];
const newLength = compress(chars);
console.log("New Length:", newLength);
console.log("Modified Array:", chars.slice(0, newLength));
```
