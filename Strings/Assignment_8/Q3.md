# Question-3: Given two strings word1 and word2, return the minimum number of steps required to make word1 and word2 the same.


- In one step, you can delete exactly one character in either string.


```
Example 1:
Input: word1 = "sea", word2 = "eat"
Output: 2
Explanation: You need one step to make "sea" to "ea" and another step to make "eat" to "ea".
```


## Solution


### Optimal Approach


#### Algorithm


- Time Complexity: $O(m*n)$
- Space Complexity: $O(m*n)$


#### Code


```javascript
const minStepsToDelete = (word1, word2) => {
    const m = word1.length;
    const n = word2.length;

    // Create a 2D array to store the lengths of the Longest Common Subsequnce
    const dp = Array.from({ length: m + 1 }, () => new Array(n + 1).fill(0));

    // Compute the lengths of the LCS using dynamic programming
    for (let i = 1; i <= m; i++) {
        for (let j = 1; j <= n; j++) {
            if (word1[i - 1] === word2[j - 1]) {
                dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1] + 1;
            } else {
                dp[i][j] = Math.max(dp[i - 1][j], dp[i][j - 1]);
            }
        }
    }

    const lcsLength = dp[m][n];
    const steps = m + n - 2 * lcsLength;
    return steps;
};
const word1 = "sea", word2 = "eat";
console.log("Minimum steps required:", minStepsToDelete(word1, word2));
```
