# Question-5: You have n coins and you want to build a staircase with these coins. The staircase consists of k rows where the ith row has exactly i coins. The last row of the staircase may be incomplete.
- Given the integer n, return *the number of complete rows of the staircase you will build*.
```
Example 1:
Input: n = 5
Output: 2
Explanation: Because the 3rd row is incomplete, we return 2.
```


## Solution


### Optimal Approach


#### Algorithm


- Time Complexity: $O(logn)$
- Space Complexity: $O(1)$


#### Code


```javascript
const arrangeCoins = (n) => {
    let left = 0;
    let right = n;

    while (left <= right) {
        const mid = Math.floor((left + right) / 2);
        const totalCoins = (mid * (mid + 1)) / 2;

        if (totalCoins === n) {
            return mid;
        } else if (totalCoins > n) {
            right = mid - 1;
        } else {
            left = mid + 1;
        }
    }

    return right;
};
const n = 5;
console.log('Maximum Complete Rows:', arrangeCoins(n));
```
