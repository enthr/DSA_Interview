# Question-2: Alice has n candies, where the ith candy is of type candyType[i]. Alice noticed that she started to gain weight, so she visited a doctor.


- The doctor advised Alice to only eat n / 2 of the candies she has (n is always even). Alice likes her candies very much, and she wants to eat the maximum number of different types of candies while still following the doctor's advice.
- Given the integer array candyType of length n, return the maximum number of different types of candies she can eat if she only eats n / 2 of them.


```
Example 1:
Input: candyType = [1,1,2,2,3,3]
Output: 3

Explanation: Alice can only eat 6 / 2 = 3 candies. Since there are only 3 types, she can eat one of each type.
```


## Solution


### Optimal Approach


#### Algorithm


- Initilize uniqueCandies Set with candyType Array this gives a set with unique candy types only.
- Maximum number of candies Alice can eat it maxEat = candyType.length / 2.
- Return minimum between uniqueCadies set's size and maxEat.
- Time Complexity: $O(n)$
- Space Complexity: $O(k)$ where k = unique candy types


#### Code


```javascript
const candyType = [1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3];
const maxCandiesToEat = (candyType) => {
    const maxEat = candyType.length / 2;
    const uniqueCandies = new Set(candyType);
    return Math.min(uniqueCandies.size, maxEat);
};
console.log('Unique Candies To Eat: ', maxCandiesToEat(candyType));
```
