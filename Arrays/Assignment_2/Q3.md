# Question-3: We define a harmonious array as an array where the difference between its maximum value and its minimum value is exactly 1.


- Given an integer array nums, return the length of its longest harmonious subsequence among all its possible subsequences.
- A subsequence of an array is a sequence that can be derived from the array by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.


```
Example 1:
Input: nums = [1,3,2,2,5,2,3,7]
Output: 5

Explanation: The longest harmonious subsequence is [3,2,2,2,3].
```


## Solution


### Optimal Approach


#### Algorithm


- Time Complexity: $O(n)$
- Space Complexity: $O(k)$ where k = unique elements


#### Code


```javascript
const nums = [1, 3, 2, 2, 5, 2, 3, 7];
const findLHS = (nums) => {
    const frequencyCounter = new Map();
    let output = 0;

    for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
        if (!frequencyCounter.has(nums[i])) frequencyCounter.set(nums[i], 0);
        frequencyCounter.set(nums[i], frequencyCounter.get(nums[i]) + 1);

        const subsequences1 = frequencyCounter.has(nums[i] - 1) ? frequencyCounter.get(nums[i]) + frequencyCounter.get(nums[i] - 1) : 0;
        const subsequences2 = frequencyCounter.has(nums[i] + 1) ? frequencyCounter.get(nums[i]) + frequencyCounter.get(nums[i] + 1) : 0;

        output = Math.max(output, subsequences1, subsequences2);
    }

    return output;
};
console.log('Longest Harmonious Subsequence: ', findLHS(nums));
```
