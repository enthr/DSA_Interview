# Q1. Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.


- You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.
- You can return the answer in any order.


```
Example:
Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [0,1]
Explanation: Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1]
```


## Solution


### Brute Force Approach


#### Algorithm


- Initialize an empty `solutions` array.
- Loop from the second element (index 1) to the last element of the array.
    - For each iteration, compare the sum of first element and the current element with the target value.
    - If the sum matches the target, push the indices of first element and the current element into the `solutions` array.
- Repeat Loop for all remaining elements.
- Print the `solutions` array.
- the first element will have (n-1) comparison, the second will have (n-2) comparisons, the third will have (n-3) comparisons till 1 comparison therefore total comparisons = n(n-1)/2
- Time Complexity: O(n^2)
- Space Complexity: O(1)


#### Code


```javascript
const arr = [2, 7, 11, 15];
const target = 9;
const findPairs = (arr, target) => {
    const solutions = [];
    for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
        for (let j = i + 1; j < arr.length; j++) {
            if (arr[i] + arr[j] === target) solutions.push([i, j]);
        }
    }
    return solutions;
}
console.log(findPairs(arr, target));
```


### Optimal Approach


#### Algorithm


- Initialize an empty `solutions` array and a `complementIndexes` hashtable.
- Loop over the array:
  - For each element at index i:
    - Calculate the complement value as `complement = target - arr[i]`.
    - Check if the complement value exists in the hashtable:
      - If it does, push the indexes of current and complement `[complementIndexes[complement], i]` as a pair to the solutions array.
    - Add the current element and its index to the hashtable as `complementIndexes[arr[i]] = i`.
- Print the solutions array.


#### Code


```javascript
const arr = [2, 7, 11, 15];
const target = 9;
const findPairs = (arr, target) => {
    const solutions = [];
    const complementIndexes = {};
    for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
        let complement = target - arr[i];
        if (complementIndexes.hasOwnProperty(complement)) solutions.push([complementIndexes[complement], i]);
        complementIndexes[arr[i]] = i;
    }
    return solutions;
}
console.log(findPairs(arr, target));
```
