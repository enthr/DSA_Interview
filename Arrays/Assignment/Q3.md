# Q3. Given a sorted array of distinct integers and a target value, return the index if the target is found. If not, return the index where it would be if it were inserted in order.


- You must write an algorithm with $O(log n)$ runtime complexity.


```
Example 1:
Input: nums = [1,3,5,6], target = 5
Output: 2
```


## Solution


- No Brute Force Approach Needed since runtime complexity is given. And Array is already sorted. Use Binary Search


### Optimal Approach


#### Algorithm


- Intialize two pointers start = 0 and end = length of array.
- While start <= end
  - Calculate mid = (start+end)/2
  - if nums[mid] is equal to target return mid
  - if nums[mid] < target then start = mid + 1
  - if nums[mid] > target then end = mid - 1
- if target is not found return start as the index where it would be inserted in order.
- Time Complexity: $O(log n)$
- Space Complexity: $O(1)$


#### Code


```javascript
const nums = [1, 3, 5, 6];
const target = 5;
const findIndex = (arr, target) => {
    let start = 0, end = arr.length - 1;
    while (start <= end) {
        let mid = Math.floor((start + end)/2);
        if (arr[mid] === target) return mid;
        if(arr[mid] < target) start = mid + 1;
        if(arr[mid] > target) end = mid - 1;
    }
    return start;
}
console.log('Index: ', findIndex(nums, target));
```
