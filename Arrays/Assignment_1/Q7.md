# Q7. Given an integer array nums, move all 0's to the end of it while maintaining the relative order of the nonzero elements.


- Note that you must do this in-place without making a copy of the array.


```
Example 1:
Input: nums = [0,1,0,3,12]
Output: [1,3,12,0,0]
```


## Solution


### Optimal Approach


#### Algorithm


- Initialize a variable count to keep track of the number of non-zero elements.
- Loop over the array nums and for each non-zero element, swap it with the element at the current count position and increment the count by one.
- After the iteration, all non-zero elements will be moved to the front of the array, and the count value will represent the index where the zeros should start.
- Iterate again from the count position to the end of the array and set all elements to zero.
- Time Complexity: $O(n)$
- Space Complexity: $O(1)$


#### Code


```javascript
const nums = [0, 1, 0, 3, 12];
const moveZeros = () => {
    let count = 0;
    for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
        if (nums[i] !== 0) {
            nums[count] = nums[i];
            count++;
        }
    }
    for (count; count < nums.length; count++) {
        nums[count] = 0;
    }
    return nums;
}
console.log('Array: ', moveZeros());
```
