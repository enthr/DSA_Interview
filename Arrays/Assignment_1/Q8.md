# Q8. You have a set of integers s, which originally contains all the numbers from 1 to n. Unfortunately, due to some error, one of the numbers in s got duplicated to another number in the set, which results in repetition of one number and loss of another number.


- You are given an integer array nums representing the data status of this set after the error.
- Find the number that occurs twice and the number that is missing and return them in the form of an array.


```
Example 1:
Input: nums = [1,2,2,4]
Output: [2,3]
```


## Solution


### Optimal Approach


#### Algorithm


- Initialize an empty hash set.
- Loop over each number in the input array nums.
  - If the number is not already present in the hash set, add it.
  - If the number is already present in the hash set, it means it is the duplicate number. return current element arr[i] and missing element i+1 since i starts at zero but arrays first element starts from 1 therefore missing element is i+1.
- Time Complexity: $O(n)$
- Space Complexity: $O(n)$


#### Code


```javascript
const nums = [1, 2, 2, 4];
const findDuplicate = (arr) => {
    const numberStore = new Set();
    for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
        if (numberStore.has(arr[i])) {
            return [arr[i], i+1];
        } else {
            numberStore.add(arr[i]);
        }
    }
}
console.log('Duplicate and Missing: ', findDuplicate(nums));
```
