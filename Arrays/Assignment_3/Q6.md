# Question-6: Given a non-empty array of integers nums, every element appears twice except for one. Find that single one.


- You must implement a solution with a linear runtime complexity and use only constant extra space.


```
Example 1:
Input: nums = [2,2,1]
Output: 1
```


## Solution


### Optimal Approach


#### Algorithm


- Time Complexity: $O(n)$
- Space Complexity: $O(1)$


#### Code


```javascript
const nums = [2, 2, 1];
const singleNumber = (nums) => {
    let result = 0;

    for (let num of nums) {
        result ^= num;
    }

    return result;
};
console.log('Single Number:', singleNumber(nums));
```
