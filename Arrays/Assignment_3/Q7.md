# Question-7: You are given an inclusive range [lower, upper] and a sorted unique integer array nums, where all elements are within the inclusive range.


- A number x is considered missing if x is in the range [lower, upper] and x is not in nums.
- Return the shortest sorted list of ranges that exactly covers all the missing numbers. That is, no element of nums is included in any of the ranges, and each missing number is covered by one of the ranges.


```
Example 1:
Input: nums = [0,1,3,50,75], lower = 0, upper = 99
Output: [[2,2],[4,49],[51,74],[76,99]]

Explanation: The ranges are:
[2,2]
[4,49]
[51,74]
[76,99]
```


## Solution


### Optimal Approach


#### Algorithm


- Time Complexity: $O(n)$
- The number of missing numbers can be at most upper - lower + 1. Therefore, the space complexity of the solution is $O(upper-lower)$


#### Code


```javascript
const nums = [0, 1, 3, 50, 75], lower = 0, upper = 99;
const findMissingRanges = (nums, lower, upper) => {
    const result = [];
    let start = lower;

    for (let num of nums) {
        if (num > start) {
            result.push([start, num - 1]);
        }
        start = num + 1;
    }

    if (start <= upper) {
        result.push([start, upper]);
    }

    return result;
};
console.log('Missing Ranges:', findMissingRanges(nums, lower, upper));
```
